        "blabla" =>"<br/><h4>DISCLOSURE OF ELECTRONIC SERVICES USAGE DATA</h4>
T&amp;S INTERNATIONAL GROUP only discloses Electronic Services usage data to third parties as
permitted by law, if we are legally obliged to do so or if such disclosure becomes necessary to
enforce our rights, in particular to enforce claims arising from a contractual relationship. Within
this scope as well as for the purpose of optimising our products and services, we may transmit
data within the T&amp;S INTERNATIONAL GROUP between GROUP companies in Indonesia or abroad.
Furthermore, we may disclose data to external service providers if this is necessary for the
provision of products and services. Such service providers may not use the data for any other
purpose than to process the order in question. All of the above persons and entities that may
receive data must observe the applicable national and international data protection laws as well
as the data protection standards of T&amp;S INTERNATIONAL GROUP.
Where so prescribed by applicable legislation, T&amp;S INTERNATIONAL GROUP may on request or
under an ongoing duty to provide information disclose data to supervisory authorities, judicial
authorities or other persons of authority.
<br/><Br/><h4>SECURITY MEASURES OF T&amp;S INTERNATIONAL GROUP</h4>
T&amp;S INTERNATIONAL GROUP will make every effort to take appropriate technical and
organisational security measures to ensure that your personal data processed within the IT
environment controlled by T&amp;S INTERNATIONAL GROUP is protected against unauthorised access,
misuse, loss and/or destruction, taking account of the applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.<br/>
T&amp;S INTERNATIONAL GROUP takes both physical and electronic process-specific security
measures, including firewalls, personal passwords, and encryption and authentication
technologies. Our employees and the service providers commissioned by us are bound by
professional secrecy and must comply with all data protection provisions.
Additionally, access to personal data is restricted to only those employees, contractors and third
parties who require this access in order to assure the purpose of data processing and the
provision of products and services (need to know principle).<br/>
<br/><h4>TRANSMISSION OF DATA VIA AN OPEN NETWORK </h4>
T&amp;S INTERNATIONAL GROUP would like to draw your attention to the fact that if you use our
Electronic Services via an open network, this may allow third parties (e.g. app stores, network
providers or the manufacturer of your device), wherever they are located, to access and process
your data. Open networks are beyond T&amp;S INTERNATIONAL GROUP control and can therefore not
be regarded as a secure environment. Any transmission of data via such open network cannot be
guaranteed to be secure or error-free as data may be intercepted, amended, corrupted, lost,
destroyed, arrive late or incomplete, contain viruses or may be monitored. In particular, data sent
via an open network may leave the country – even where both sender and recipient are in the
same country – and may be transmitted to and potentially processed in third-party countries,
where data protection requirements may be lower than in your country of residence.
Where data is transmitted via an open network, we cannot be held responsible for the protection
of this data and we accept no responsibility or liability for the security of your data during
transmission. We, therefore, recommend avoiding the transmission of any strictly confidential
information via open networks.
